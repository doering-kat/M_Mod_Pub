Please not that a folder named 1_\* is purposefully missing. This is because it contained scripts to manipulate a raw version of the fall survey data that was ultimately deemed not useful to include in the repository. You can see the output of those scripts in the Derived_Data/1\* folder, which includes a cleaned version of the fall survey data used in by the model.
